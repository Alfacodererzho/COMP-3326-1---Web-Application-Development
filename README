# Town Hall Website Project

This project is part of the exercises for developing a new version of the "Town Hall" website from the book **"A Crash Course in HTML and CSS"**. The exercise spans chapters 3 to 8, where the goal is to develop a website with different content, formatting, and layouts compared to the original example in the book.

## Folder Structure
The project uses a realistic folder structure as follows:

```
town_hall_1/
│
├── images/
├── speakers/
├── styles/
├── templates/
└── text/
```
- **images/**: Contains the image files used in the website.
- **speakers/**: Contains HTML pages for the speakers.
- **styles/**: Holds the CSS files for styling.
- **templates/**: Contains reusable HTML templates.
- **text/**: Contains text files with the content used in the web pages.

## Key Features
- Develop a home page with proper HTML structure including headers, footers, and main content sections.
- Proper usage of `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` tags for headings and paragraphs.
- Use of `<img>` tags for images and specifying attributes such as `alt`, `width`, and `height`.
- Use of links and references for speaker profiles.
- Validation and testing of HTML in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer).

   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the homepage.

## Instructions
